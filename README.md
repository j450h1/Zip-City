Zip-City
========

This a shiny application created for the Coursera class: Developing Data Products as part of the Data Science Specialization. This application takes a list of zipcodes for one city from any site and maps them on a city map.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

Click on submit to see the default map of Bellingham, WA with the zipcodes that were found on the default site. 

If you want to override the defaults, ensure that the website contains US zipcodes from one US city only in the body of the webpage.

Do remember to type in both the City and State for the zipcode you are looking for.

Click on submit.

LIMITATIONS
============

If you enter a URL with zipcodes outside of one city, those zips will not appear on the map.

The URL must be http and not https.
